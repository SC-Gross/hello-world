To All,

I teach math for Alamo Community Colleges.  Starting this Summer, I am also a Master's student at Texas State University - San Marcos on the Data Sciences track.  Eventually, I hope to teach Computer Science and analyze Economic data for public service and non-profit institutions.  In this respository, I am testing all the features of GitHub so I can participate in class group projects.  I love Asian food of all kinds and swimming in the San Marcos river.
